\title{Convolutional Neural Networks with PEMAN}
\author{Dhushyanth S}

\abstract{
	The use of hybrid photonic electronic neuromorphic structures to emulate the neurons of a artifical neural network, notably the multi-layered perceptron architecture has already been thoroughly explored. This report aims to expand the scope to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The use of CNNs in todays world is briefly reviewed, follwing which a method to visualize CNN as a multi-layered perceptron is introduced. The use of PEMAN to emulate the visualisation is then discussed.
