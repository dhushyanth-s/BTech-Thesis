\textit{\quad
	Machine Learning and Deep Learning are one of the most busy fields of todays society, having constants inventions and breakthroughs. This thesis aims to improve the hardware capabilities of the field by introducing a new hardware call PEMAN to fabricate an entire neural network from a signel neuron. Since a single structure is reused, it does not suffer from the inflexibility of its photonic predecessors. This structures uses in ANN and CNN domain is studied, and a new training algorithm for training on reduced bit precision PEMAN hardware is proposed.
